        "  Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects represent real-world entities and can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. The four fundamental principles of OOP are:\n",

        " Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components to protect the object's integrity.\n",

        " Inheritance: Mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another, promoting code reusability.\n",

        "- 11.What is Method Overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",

It is commonly used to implement getter and setter methods in a clean and Pythonic way.\n",

        "\n",
        " Polymorphism allows you to use a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). It’s important because it provides flexibility and scalability in your code. With polymorphism, you can write more generic code, and the program can handle different types of objects uniformly, thus simplifying code maintenance and extension.\n",
