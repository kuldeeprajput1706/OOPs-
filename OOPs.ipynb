        "  Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Objects represent real-world entities and can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. The four fundamental principles of OOP are:\n",

        " Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components to protect the object's integrity.\n",

        " Inheritance: Mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another, promoting code reusability.\n",

        "\n",
